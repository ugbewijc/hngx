## Stage Two Task
<br/>
Build a simple REST API capable of CRUD operations on a "person" resource, interfacing with any database of your choice. Your API should dynamically handle parameters, such as adding or retrieving a person by name. Accompany the development with UML diagrams to represent your system's design and database structure.  Host your entire project on GitHub, and provide a well-structured documentation in the repository that outlines request/response formats, setup instructions, and sample API usage.
#### Task Breakdown:
Develop a REST API with Basic CRUD Operation
<br/>
#### Objective:
Build a simple REST API capable of CRUD operations on a resource, say, a "person". The chosen programming language should interface with any chosen database of your choice.
- **REST API Development:**
Develop an API with endpoints for:
    - ***CREATE:*** Adding a new person.  =>/api
    - ***READ:*** Fetching details of a person.  => /api/user_id
    - ***UPDATE:*** Modifying details of an existing person => /api/user_id
    - ***DELETE:*** Removing a person => /api/user_id

  Ensure all interactions with the database are secure and free from common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injections).
- **Database Modelling: (Bonus)**
    - UML Diagram: Design and present a UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that represents the structure and relationships of your API's classes and models.
- **Testing:**
Using tools like Postman or (scripts written in Python using the requests library) that tests each CRUD operation in your API.
This  should:
  - Add a new person (e.g., "Mark Essien").
  - Fetch details of a person
  - Modify the details of an existing person.
  - Remove a person
- **Dynamic Parameter Handling:**
Your API should be flexible enough to handle dynamic input. If we provide a name (or other details), your backend should be able to process operations using that name.
Example: If we pass "Mark Essien", we should be able to perform all CRUD operations on "Mark Essien".
**Add validation** â€“ field should only be strings; integers or any other data type should not be allowed.
- **GitHub Repository:**
Create a GitHub repository for this project.
Ensure the repository contains:
  - A detailed README.md file explaining how to set up, run, and use the API.
  - The source code for the API.
  - UML diagrams (or links to view them).
- **Documentation:**
Provide a documentation file (e.g., DOCUMENTATION.md in your GitHub repo) that outlines:
  - Standard formats for requests and responses for each endpoint.
  - Sample usage of the API, including example requests and expected responses.
  - Any known limitations or assumptions made during development.
  - Instructions for setting up and deploying the API locally or on a server.
- **Hosting**
Using the same Server used in the Stage One task (or another server, if possible), modify it accordingly to  host your endpoint with a URL like this https://theirdomain.com/api
Test extensively with various testing tools to make sure it is accessible before submitting

#### Acceptance Criteria
- **Functional REST API:** The API should successfully perform all CRUD operations.
- **Modelling Diagrams:** Clear and accurate UML and E-R diagrams should be provided.
**Effective Testing Script:** The script should successfully test all the CRUD operations without manual intervention.
**Dynamic Parameter Handling:** The API should correctly handle and respond to different parameters provided.
**GitHub Repository:** Repository should be well-organized, contain all necessary files, and be publicly accessible.
**Detailed Documentation:** Documentation should provide clear guidance on how to use the API, including setup, request/response formats, and sample usage.
